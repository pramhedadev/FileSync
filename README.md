Decentralized File Storage

The app gives is used for backing up files and syncs files. I used IPFS to allow us to upload files in a decentralized way and also allows us to share with others in a trustless censorship resistant fashion.

We use our web browser to connect to a blockchain wallet to the blockchain and that is where we store the code for the application. We use ethereum smart contract to store the location of the file and we store the files on IPFS, and no central party can take these files down.

Run ganache-cli ... allows us to make calls to the blockchain

Run truffle migrate --reset ... deploy contracts to the Ethereum network.

Run truffle test ... enables us to use javascript for testing
